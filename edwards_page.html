<h2> Edward's About me </h2>



<h4>Short Intro</h4>

<p>The high school I attended is relatively new as I was the 5th year to graduate.
My high school, Academy for Software Engineering, was located in downtown Manhattan, Union Square.
The reason I chose to attend this highschool was because I found great interest in Computer Science and wanted to get a head start before learning programming in college.
Even with attending this high school, I still wanted to expand my knowledge and decided to join a program for game design outside of the school.
This program was called SIA which taught students how to program in C# and create games through Unity.
A few hobbies I do outside of class are practicing guitar, playing soccer, practicing Krav Maga and playing badminton.</p>
